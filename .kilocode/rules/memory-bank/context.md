## Current Focus

The resume is fully customized. Potential next steps:
1. Add profile photo to `/public/images/profile.jpg`
2. Add project thumbnails to `/public/projects/`
3. Adjust theme color if desired
4. Test and deploy

## Known Considerations

- Profile image expects `/images/profile.jpg` → Add real photo
- Project thumbnails expect `/projects/` images → Add screenshots
- Contact form needs backend integration for email

## Pending Improvements (Optional)

- [ ] Add profile photo
- [ ] Add project screenshots
- [ ] Add more theme color presets
- [ ] Add testimonials/recommendations section
